# Software-Development-Assignment-2-Chat-App

## 1.0 Pre-Requisite Information

### 1.1 Project Introduction
This project is a web chat app optimised for mobile use. This chat app is split into two folders, front end and backend. The front end utilises React a JavaScript Framework and css for styling as well as websockets to communicate between the client and the server. The back end is composed of an express JS application wrapped in a http server thus allowing websocket to communicate between the client and the server. The project is composed of two main screens the "Get Started" screen that loads when the user is yet to input a name and the chat room screen that is accessed once the user has input a name.

### 1.2 Install Instructions 
To install this project first open terminal and input the following command. 
``` 
git clone https://github.com/Gray593/Software-Development-Assignment-2-Chat-App 
``` 
Next open another terminal instance, this is done as a seperate terminal instance is needed for both the back end and front end. Then run these commands in the terminal you have decided is for the front end. 
```
cd frontEnd
npm i 
``` 
Next switch to the back end terminal and run the following.
```
cd backEnd
npm i

```
Do not kill either terminal instance after this as both are needed to run the program.
### 1.3 How to Run
Using the terminals create in the projects installation, run the following command in the "frontEnd" terminal 
```
npm start
``` 
Next run the follwoing command in the "backEnd" terminal 
```
node backEnd.js
```
the front end may take a second to start but dont worry just switch to the back end and run the back end  command as both terminals can run simultaneously.
