This project is a web chat app optimised for mobile use. This chat app is split into two folders, front end and backend. The front end utilises React a JavaScript Framework and css for styling as well as websockets to communicate between the client and the server. The back end is composed of an express JS application wrapped in a http server thus allowing websocket to communicate between the client and the server. The project is composed of two main screens the "Get Started" screen that loads when the user is yet to input a name and the chat room screen that is accessed once the user has input a name.
